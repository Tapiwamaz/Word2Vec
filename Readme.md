# Goal

## Vary the number of negative samples and see the difference between the embeddings space and aslo see how it affect the learning speed ( how long the algorithm takes to converge, if it ever does)

### Where in the code do we configure the the number of samples? 
### How do we compare embedding spaces/ embeddings?
### Why did we choos the parameters e.g loss function, embedding dimension...?
